# Nexeven Sense iOS Sample (Swift)
This is a sample implementation of [SenseKit](https://github.com/nexeven/SenseKit)

**Note:** Running this sample requires Carthage.

## Installing Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Run `carthage update`, open `SenseKit Sample.xcodeproj` and run the app.
